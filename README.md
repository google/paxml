# Paxml (aka Pax)

Pax is a framework to configure and run machine learning experiments on top of Jax.
## Quickstart
### Setting up a Cloud TPU VM

We refer to
[this page](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/users-guide-tpu-vm#managing_tpus)
for more exhaustive documentation about starting a Cloud TPU project. The
following command is sufficient to create a Cloud TPU VM with 8 cores from a
corp machine.

```bash
export ZONE=us-central2-b
export VERSION=tpu-vm-v4-base
export PROJECT=<your-project>
export ACCELERATOR=v4-8
export TPU_NAME=paxml

#create a TPU VM
gcloud compute tpus tpu-vm create $TPU_NAME \
--zone=$ZONE --version=$VERSION \
--project=$PROJECT \
--accelerator-type=$ACCELERATOR
```

If you are using TPU Pod slices, please refer to [this guide](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/jax-pods). Run all the commands from a local machine using [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) with the `--worker=all` option:

```bash
gcloud compute tpus tpu-vm ssh $TPU_NAME --zone=$ZONE \
--worker=all --command="<commmands>"
```

The following quickstart sections assume you run on a single-host TPU, so you can ssh to the VM and run the commands there.

```bash
gcloud compute tpus tpu-vm ssh $TPU_NAME --zone=$ZONE
```

### Installing Pax

After ssh-ing the VM, you can install the paxml stable release from PyPI, or the dev version from GitHub.

For installing the stable release from PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/paxml/):

```bash
python3 -m pip install -U pip
python3 -m pip install paxml jax[tpu] \
-f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/libtpu_releases.html
```

If you encounter issues with transitive dependencies and you are using the native Cloud TPU VM environment, please navigate to the corresponding release branch rX.Y.Z and download `paxml/pip_package/requirements.txt`. This file includes the exact versions of all transitive dependencies needed in the native Cloud TPU VM environment, in which we build/test the corresponding release.

```bash
git clone -b rX.Y.Z https://github.com/google/paxml
pip install --no-deps -r paxml/paxml/pip_package/requirements.txt
```

For installing the dev version from GitHub, and for the ease of editing code:

```bash
# install the dev version of praxis first
git clone https://github.com/google/praxis
pip install -e praxis
git clone https://github.com/google/paxml
pip install -e paxml
pip install "jax[tpu]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/libtpu_releases.html
```

### Run a test model
```bash
# example model using pjit (SPMD)
python3 .local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/paxml/main.py \
--exp=tasks.lm.params.lm_cloud.LmCloudSpmd2BLimitSteps \
--job_log_dir=gs://<your-bucket>

# example model using pmap
python3 .local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/paxml/main.py \
--exp=tasks.lm.params.lm_cloud.LmCloudTransformerAdamLimitSteps \
--job_log_dir=gs://<your-bucket> \
--pmap_use_tensorstore=True
```
### Documentations
Please visit our [docs folder](https://github.com/google/paxml/tree/main/paxml/docs) for documentations and Jupyter Notebook tutorials. Please see the following section for instructions of running Jupyter Notebooks on a Cloud TPU VM.

### Run a notebook
You can run the [example notebooks](paxml/docs/tutorials) in the TPU VM in which you just installed paxml.
####Steps to enable a notebook in a `v4-8`

1. ssh in TPU VM with port forwarding
`gcloud compute tpus tpu-vm ssh $TPU_NAME --project=$PROJECT_NAME    --zone=$ZONE    --ssh-flag="-4 -L 8080:localhost:8080"`

2. install jupyter notebook on the TPU vm and downgrade markupsafe
 ```
 pip install notebook
 pip install markupsafe==2.0.1
 ```
3. export `jupyter` path
`export PATH=/home/$USER/.local/bin:$PATH`

4. scp the [example notebooks](paxml/docs/tutorials) to your TPU VM
`gcloud compute tpus tpu-vm scp  $TPU_NAME:<path inside TPU> <local path of the notebooks>   --zone=$ZONE --project=$PROJECT`

5. start jupyter notebook from the TPU VM and note the token generated by jupyter notebook
 `jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8080`

6. then in your local browser go to: http://localhost:8080/ and enter the token provided

Note: In case you need to start using a second notebook while the first notebook is still occupying the TPUs, you can run
`pkill -9 python3`
to free up the TPUs.

### Run on GPU

Note: NVIDIA has released an updated version of Pax with H100 FP8 support and broad GPU performance improvements. Please visit the [NVIDIA Rosetta](https://github.com/NVIDIA/JAX-Toolbox/tree/main/rosetta/rosetta/projects/pax) repository for more details and usage instructions.

#### Run PGLE workflow on GPU


The Profile Guided Latency Estimator (PGLE) workflow measures the actual running time
of compute and collectives, the the profile information is fed back into XLA compiler
for a better scheduling decision.

The workflow to use the Profile Guided Latency Estimator workflow in XLA/GPU is:

- 1. Run your workload once, with async collectives and latency hiding scheduler enabled.

You could do so by setting:

```bash
export XLA_FLAGS="--xla_gpu_enable_latency_hiding_scheduler=true"
```

- 2. Collect and post process a profile by using JAX profiler, saving the extracted instruction latencies into a binary protobuf file.

```python
import os
from etils import epath
import jax
from jax.experimental import profiler as exp_profiler

# Define your profile directory
profile_dir = 'gs://my_bucket/profile'
jax.profiler.start_trace(profile_dir)

# run your workflow
# for i in range(10):
#   train_step()

# Stop trace
jax.profiler.stop_trace()
profile_dir = epath.Path(profile_dir)
directories = profile_dir.glob('plugins/profile/*/')
directories = [d for d in directories if d.is_dir()]
rundir = directories[-1]
logging.info('rundir: %s', rundir)

# Post process the profile
fdo_profile = exp_profiler.get_profiled_instructions_proto(os.fspath(rundir))

# Save the profile proto to a file.
dump_dir = rundir / 'profile.pb'
dump_dir.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
dump_dir.write_bytes(fdo_profile)

```

After this step, you will get a `profile.pb` file under the `rundir` printed in the code.

- 3. Run the workload again feeding that file into the compilation.

You need to pass the `profile.pb` file to the `--xla_gpu_pgle_profile_file_or_directory_path` flag.

```bash
 export XLA_FLAGS="--xla_gpu_enable_latency_hiding_scheduler=true --xla_gpu_pgle_profile_file_or_directory_path=/path/to/profile/profile.pb"
```

To enable logging in the XLA and check if the profile is good, set the logging level to include `INFO`:

```bash
export TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL=0
```

Run the real workflow, if you found these loggings in the running log, it means the profiler is used in the latency hiding scheduler:

```

```

### FAQs

1. Pax runs on Jax, you can find details on running Jax jobs on Cloud TPU [here](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/run-calculation-jax), also you can find details on running Jax jobs on a Cloud TPU pod [here](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/jax-pods)

2. If you run into dependency errors, please refer to the `requirements.txt` file in the branch corresponding to the stable release you are installing.
For e.g., for the [stable release 0.4.0](https://pypi.org/project/paxml/0.4.0/) use branch `r0.4.0` and refer to the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/google/paxml/blob/r0.4.0/paxml/pip_package/requirements.txt) for the exact versions of the dependencies used for the stable release.

## Benchmark on Cloud TPU v4
The [PaLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02311) paper introduced an efficiency metric called Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU). This is measured as the ratio of the observed throughput (in, for example, tokens per second for a language model) to the theoretical maximum throughput of a system harnessing 100% of peak FLOPs. It differs from other ways of measuring compute utilization because it doesnâ€™t include FLOPs spent on activation rematerialization during the backward pass, meaning that efficiency as measured by MFU translates directly into end-to-end training speed.

To evaluate the MFU of a key class of workloads on TPU v4 Pods with Pax, we carried out an in-depth benchmark campaign on a series of decoder-only Transformer language model (GPT) configurations that range in size from billions to trillions of parameters on the [c4 dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/c4). The following graph shows the training efficiency using the "weak scaling" pattern where we grew the model size in
proportion to the number of chips used.

## Pax on Multislice
The multislice configs in this repo refer to
[1. Singlie slice configs](https://github.com/google/paxml/blob/main/paxml/tasks/lm/params/c4.py)
for syntax / model architecture
and
[2. MaxText repo](https://github.com/google/maxtext)
for config values.


We provide example runs under c4_multislice.py` as a starting point for Pax on multislice.


### Setting up Cloud TPU VMs using Queued Resources


We refer to
[this page](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/queued-resources)
for more exhaustive documentation about using Queued Resources for a multi-slice Cloud TPU project. The
following shows the steps needed to set up TPUs for running example configs in this repo.


```bash
export ZONE=us-central2-b
export VERSION=tpu-vm-v4-base
export PROJECT=<your-project>
export ACCELERATOR=v4-128 # or v4-384 depending on which config you run
```


Say, for running `C4Spmd22BAdam2xv4_128` on 2 slices of v4-128, you'd need to set up TPUs the following way:

```bash
export TPU_PREFIX=<your-prefix> # New TPUs will be created based off this prefix
export QR_ID=$TPU_PREFIX
export NODE_COUNT=<number-of-slices> # 1, 2, or 4 depending on which config you run


#create a TPU VM
gcloud alpha compute tpus queued-resources create $QR_ID --accelerator-type=$ACCELERATOR --runtime-version=tpu-vm-v4-base --node-count=$NODE_COUNT --node-prefix=$TPU_PREFIX
```


### Installing Pax


The setup commands described earlier need to be run on ALL workers in ALL slices. You can 1) ssh into each worker and each slice individually; or 2) use for loop with `--worker=all` flag as the following command.


```bash
for ((i=0; i<$NODE_COUNT; i++))
do
gcloud compute tpus tpu-vm ssh $TPU_PREFIX-$i --zone=us-central2-b --worker=all --command="pip install paxml && pip install orbax==0.1.1 && pip install \"jax[tpu]\" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/libtpu_releases.html"
done
```


### Run a test multislice model
In order to run the multislice configs, open the same number of terminals as your $NODE_COUNT. For our experiments on 2 slices(`C4Spmd22BAdam2xv4_128`), open two terminals. Then, run each of these commands individually from each terminal.

From Terminal 0, run training command for slice 0 as follows:

```bash
export TPU_PREFIX=<your-prefix>
export EXP_NAME=C4Spmd22BAdam2xv4_128
export LIBTPU_INIT_ARGS=\"--xla_jf_spmd_threshold_for_windowed_einsum_mib=0 --xla_tpu_spmd_threshold_for_allgather_cse=10000 --xla_enable_async_all_gather=true --jax_enable_async_collective_offload=true --xla_tpu_enable_latency_hiding_scheduler=true TPU_MEGACORE=MEGACORE_DENSE\"
gcloud compute tpus tpu-vm ssh $TPU_PREFIX-0 --zone=us-central2-b --worker=all \
--command="LIBTPU_INIT_ARGS=$LIBTPU_INIT_ARGS JAX_USE_PJRT_C_API_ON_TPU=1 \
python3 /home/yooh/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/paxml/main.py \
--exp=tasks.lm.params.c4_multislice.${EXP_NAME} --job_log_dir=gs://<your-bucket>"
```


From Terminal 1, concurrently run training command for slice 1 as follows:

```bash
export TPU_PREFIX=<your-prefix>
export EXP_NAME=C4Spmd22BAdam2xv4_128
export LIBTPU_INIT_ARGS=\"--xla_jf_spmd_threshold_for_windowed_einsum_mib=0 --xla_tpu_spmd_threshold_for_allgather_cse=10000 --xla_enable_async_all_gather=true --jax_enable_async_collective_offload=true --xla_tpu_enable_latency_hiding_scheduler=true TPU_MEGACORE=MEGACORE_DENSE\"
gcloud compute tpus tpu-vm ssh $TPU_PREFIX-1 --zone=us-central2-b --worker=all \
--command="LIBTPU_INIT_ARGS=$LIBTPU_INIT_ARGS JAX_USE_PJRT_C_API_ON_TPU=1 \
python3 /home/yooh/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/paxml/main.py \
--exp=tasks.lm.params.c4_multislice.${EXP_NAME} --job_log_dir=gs://<your-bucket>"
```



### MaxText to Pax
This table covers details on how the MaxText variable names have been translated to Pax.


Note that MaxText has a "scale" which is multiplied to several parameters (base_num_decoder_layers, base_emb_dim, base_mlp_dim, base_num_heads) for final values.


Another thing to mention is while Pax covers DCN and ICN MESH_SHAPE as an array, in MaxText there are separate variables of data_parallelism, fsdp_parallelism and tensor_parallelism for DCN and ICI. Since these values are set as 1 by default, only the variables with value greater than 1 are recorded in this translation table.

That is, `ICI_MESH_SHAPE = [ici_data_parallelism, ici_fsdp_parallelism, ici_tensor_parallelism]` and `DCN_MESH_SHAPE = [dcn_data_parallelism, dcn_fsdp_parallelism, dcn_tensor_parallelism]`

# Data inputs

## Intro

Input is an instance of the `BaseInput`
class for getting data into model for train/eval/decode.

```python
class BaseInput:

  def get_next(self):
    pass

  def reset(self):
    pass
```

It acts like an iterator: `get_next()` returns a `NestedMap`, where each field
is a numerical array with batch size as its leading dimension.

Each input is configured by a subclass of `BaseInput.HParams`.
In this page, we use `p` to denote an instance of a `BaseInput.Params`, and it
instantiates to `input`.

## Multihost infeed

In Pax, data is always multihost: Each Jax process will have a separate,
independent `input` instantiated. Their params will have different
`p.infeed_host_index`, set automatically by Pax.

Hence, the local batch size seen on each host is `p.batch_size`, and the global
batch size is `(p.batch_size * p.num_infeed_hosts)`. One will often see
`p.batch_size` set to `jax.local_device_count() * PERCORE_BATCH_SIZE`.

Due to this multihost nature, `input` must be sharded properly.

For training, each `input` must never emit identical batches, and for eval on a
finite dataset, each `input` must terminate after the same number of batches.
The best solution is to have the input implementation properly shard the data,
such that each `input` on different hosts do not overlap. Failing that, one can
also use different random seed to avoid duplicate batches during training.

## Input for eval data

`input.reset()` is never called on training data, but it can for eval (or
decode) data.


For each eval (or decode) run, Pax fetches `N` batches from `input` by calling
`input.get_next()` `N` times. The number of batches used, `N`, can be a fixed
number specified by user, via `p.eval_loop_num_batches`; or `N` can be dynamic
(`p.eval_loop_num_batches=None`) i.e. we call `input.get_next()` until we
exhaust all of its data (by raising `StopIteration` or `tf.errors.OutOfRange`).

If `p.reset_for_eval=True`, `p.eval_loop_num_batches` is ignored and `N` is
determined dynamically as the number of batches to exhaust the data. In this
case, `p.repeat` should be set to False, as doing otherwise would lead to
infinite decode/eval.

If `p.reset_for_eval=False`, Pax will fetch `p.eval_loop_num_batches` batches.
This should be set with `p.repeat=True` so that data are not prematurely
exhausted.

Note that LingvoEvalAdaptor inputs require `p.reset_for_eval=True`.

:                          : `eval_loop_num_batches` :                         :
:                          : . Input must repeat     :                         :
:                          : indefinitely            :                         :
:                          : (`p.repeat=True`) or    :                         :
:                          : otherwise may raise     :                         :
:                          : exception               :                         :

If running decode/eval on exactly one epoch (i.e. when `p.reset_for_eval=True`),
the input must handle sharding correctly such that each shard raises at the same
step after exactly the same number of batches are produced. This usually means
that the input must pad the eval data. This is done automatically
by`SeqIOInput` and `LingvoEvalAdaptor` (see more below).

### Eval metrics

For the majority of inputs, we only ever call `get_next()` on them to get
batches of data. One type of eval data is an exception to this, where "how to
compute metrics" is also defined on the input object as well.

This is only supported with `SeqIOInput` that defines some canonical eval
benchmark. Specifically, Pax uses `predict_metric_fns` and `score_metric_fns()` defined on the SeqIO task to compute
eval metrics (although Pax does not depend on SeqIO evaluator directly).

## Best practices

When a model uses multiple inputs, either between train/eval or different
training data between pretraining/finetuning, users must ensure that the
tokenizers used by the inputs are identical, especially when importing different
inputs implemented by others.

Users can sanity check the tokenizers by decoding some ids with
`input.ids_to_strings()`.

It's always a good idea to sanity check the data by looking at a few batches.
Users can easily reproduce the param in a colab and inspect the data:

```python
p = ... # specify the intended input param
inp = p.Instantiate()
b = inp.get_next()
print(b)
```

Training data typically should not use a fixed random seed. This is because if
the training job is preempted, training data will start to repeat itself. In
particular, for Lingvo inputs, we recommend setting `p.input.file_random_seed =
0` for training data.

To test for whether sharding is handled correctly, users can manually set
different values for `p.num_infeed_hosts, p.infeed_host_index` and see whether
the instantiated inputs emit different batches.

## Input types

Pax supports 3 types of inputs: SeqIO, Lingvo, and custom.

### SeqIO

`SeqIOInput` can be used to import datasets.

SeqIO inputs handle correct sharding and padding of eval data automatically.

### Lingvo

`LingvoInputAdaptor` can be used to import datasets.

The input is fully delegated to the Lingvo implementation, which may or may not
handle sharding automatically.

For GenericInput based Lingvo input implementation using a fixed
`packing_factor`, we recommend to use
`LingvoInputAdaptorNewBatchSize` to specify a bigger batch size for the inner Lingvo input and put the desired
(usually much smaller) batch size on `p.batch_size`.

For eval data, we recommend using
`LingvoEvalAdaptor` to handle sharding and padding for running eval over one epoch.

### Custom

Custom subclass of `BaseInput`. Users implement their own subclass, typically
with `tf.data` or SeqIO.

Users can also inherit an existing input class to only customize post processing
of batches. For example:

```python
class MyInput(base_input.LingvoInputAdaptor):

  def get_next(self):
    batch = super().get_next()
    # modify batch: batch.new_field = ...
    return batch
```

# Key Pax components

## Hyperparameters

Hyperparameters are an important part of defining models and configuring
experiments.

To integrate better with Python tooling, Pax/Praxis uses a pythonic
dataclass based configuration style for hyperparameters.

```python
class Linear(base_layer.BaseLayer):
  """Linear layer without bias."""

  class HParams(BaseHParams):
    """Associated hyperparams for this layer class.

    Attributes:
      input_dims: Depth of the input.
      output_dims: Depth of the output.
    """
    input_dims: int = 0
    output_dims: int = 0
```

### Nesting

It's also possible to nest HParams dataclasses, in the example below, the
linear_tpl attribute is a nested Linear.HParams.

## Layers

A Layer represents an arbitrary function possibly with trainable parameters. A
Layer can contain other Layers as children. Layers are the essential building
blocks of models. Layers inherit from the Flax nn.Module.

Typically layers define two methods:

### setup

This method creates trainable weights and child layers.

### fprop

This method defines the forward propagation function, computing some output
based on the inputs. Additionally, fprop might add summaries or track auxiliary
losses.

### Fiddle and Shared layers
Fiddle is an open-sourced Python-first configuration library
designed for ML applications. Pax/Praxis supports interoperability with Fiddle
Config/Partial(s) and some advanced features like eager error checking and
shared parameters.

```python
fdl_config = Linear.HParams.config(input_dims=1, output_dims=1)

# A typo.
fdl_config.input_dimz = 31337  # Raises an exception immediately to catch typos fast!


fdl_partial = Linear.HParams.partial(input_dims=1)
```

Using Fiddle, layers can be configured to be shared (eg: instantiated only once
with shared trainable weights).

## Model

A model defines solely the network, typically a collection of Layers and defines
interfaces for interacting with the model such as decoding, etc.

Some example base models
include:

*   LanguageModel
*   SequenceModel
*   ClassificationModel

## Task

A Task contains one more more Models and Learner/Optimizers. The simplest Task
subclass is a `SingleTask` which requires the following Hparams:

```python
  class HParams(base_task.BaseTask.HParams):
    """Task parameters.

    Attributes:
      name: Name of this task object, must be a valid identifier.
      model: The underlying JAX model encapsulating all the layers.
      train: HParams to control how this task should be trained.
      metrics: A BaseMetrics aggregator class to determine how metrics are
         computed.
      loss_aggregator: A LossAggregator aggregator class to derermine how the
        losses are aggregated (e.g single or MultiLoss)
      vn: HParams to control variational noise.
```
